## üìñ Project Overview
This repository contains the backend service for an AirBnB-like platform. It provides a scalable RESTful + GraphQL API that powers user management, property listings, bookings, payments, and reviews.

The service is built for clarity and extensibility so it can be used as a foundation for a modern, production-ready full-stack application.

## üéØ Goals & Core Features
- Secure user registration, authentication, and profile management
- Property listing CRUD (create, read, update, delete)
- Booking system with availability checks and booking lifecycle management
- Payment processing integration and transaction handling
- Reviews and ratings per property
- Performance optimizations: database indexing, caching (Redis)
- Background processing for async tasks (Celery)

## üß© Feature Breakdown
This section describes the main features of the backend and how each contributes to the platform.

- User Management  
  Handles user registration, authentication, authorization, and profile management. Provides roles/flags (e.g., host vs. guest), secure password storage, and endpoints for account and profile updates to support both listing owners and travelers.

- Property Management  
  Enables hosts to create, update, publish, and manage property listings including descriptions, pricing, images, amenities, and availability. Supports search/filter metadata (location, price, amenities) so consumers can discover suitable listings.

- Booking System  
  Manages booking lifecycle from availability checks, reservation requests, confirmations, modifications, and cancellations. Enforces date-range rules and prevents overlapping confirmed bookings while calculating totals, taxes, and fees.

- Payment Processing  
  Integrates with external payment providers to collect guest payments and handle refunds/payouts. Records transaction metadata and status for each booking while keeping PCI-sensitive data out of the system (using provider tokens/webhooks).

- Reviews & Ratings  
  Allows guests to leave ratings and comments for properties after a stay, aggregates scores for listings, and supports moderation controls. Optionally ties reviews to bookings to ensure authenticity and to drive trust signals on listings.

- Search & Filtering  
  Provides endpoints and query support for searching listings by location, date availability, price, and amenities. Uses indexed fields and optimized queries to return results quickly for typical user search patterns.

- Performance & Caching  
  Improves responsiveness by caching read-heavy endpoints (e.g., listing details, search results) with Redis and optimizing DB queries with indexes and select_related/prefetch_related. Ensures the system scales for higher read/write loads.

- Background Processing & Scheduling  
  Uses Celery for asynchronous tasks such as sending emails, processing payments webhooks, cleaning stale reservations, and running periodic analytics or maintenance jobs. Keeps user-facing requests fast by offloading long-running work.

- API Documentation & Developer Tools  
  Exposes interactive REST (OpenAPI/Swagger) and GraphQL playground endpoints for exploration and integration. Provides schema-driven docs, example requests, and tooling to simplify frontend integration and third-party use.

## üîê API Security
This section outlines the key security measures we will implement for the API and why each area is important.

- Authentication  
  Implement robust authentication using proven schemes (e.g., Django's session auth for admin, token-based or JWT for API clients, and OAuth2 for third-party integrations). Use strong password hashing (PBKDF2/Argon2), multi-factor authentication (MFA) for accounts with elevated privileges, and short-lived access tokens with refresh tokens where appropriate.  
  Why it matters: Ensures only verified users and clients can access protected endpoints, reducing account takeover risk and protecting user data.

- Authorization (Access Control)  
  Enforce role-based and object-level permissions (e.g., hosts vs. guests, property owner-only edits, admin moderation). Apply least-privilege principles and validate permissions in both REST and GraphQL resolvers.  
  Why it matters: Prevents unauthorized actions (editing or accessing other users' data), preserving data integrity and user privacy.

- Rate Limiting & Abuse Prevention  
  Apply per-IP and per-user rate limits (e.g., using Redis-backed throttling) to login, registration, and high-cost endpoints (search, booking creation). Implement CAPTCHA for suspicious signups and backoff strategies for repeated failures.  
  Why it matters: Mitigates brute-force attacks, API abuse, and denial-of-service risks that could degrade availability or enable fraud.

- Transport & Data Encryption  
  Enforce TLS (HTTPS) for all traffic, use HSTS, and disable insecure protocols/ciphers. Encrypt sensitive data at rest where required (e.g., encryption of backups, secrets in vaults). Use tokenization / provider-hosted fields for payment data rather than storing PCI-sensitive fields.  
  Why it matters: Protects sensitive information in transit and at rest from interception or leakage, and supports regulatory compliance (e.g., GDPR, PCI).

- Secure Payment Processing  
  Integrate with compliant payment providers (Stripe, Braintree) using tokenization and webhooks. Validate and verify webhook signatures, store minimal payment metadata, and never store raw card data. Implement reconciliation and idempotency for payment processing.  
  Why it matters: Prevents financial fraud, reduces PCI scope, and protects both users and the platform from payment-related risks.

- Input Validation & Output Encoding  
  Validate and sanitize all inputs (dates, numeric fields, file uploads) and enforce strict content types. Escape or encode outputs where user content is displayed and limit allowed file types/sizes for uploads.  
  Why it matters: Prevents injection attacks (SQL, NoSQL, command), XSS, and other data-driven exploits.

- CSRF, CORS & Secure Headers  
  Use CSRF protection for browser-based endpoints, configure CORS to restrict allowed origins, and add security headers (Content-Security-Policy, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy).  
  Why it matters: Reduces cross-site attack vectors and helps protect end-users from client-side exploits.

- Secrets & Configuration Management  
  Keep secrets out of the repository using environment variables or a secrets manager (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager). Rotate keys regularly, limit access to secrets, and use dedicated IAM roles for services.  
  Why it matters: Limits blast radius if credentials are exposed and prevents accidental leakage of sensitive keys or credentials.

- Logging, Monitoring & Incident Response  
  Centralize audit logs, authentication events, and payment events (redact sensitive fields). Integrate monitoring/alerting (Sentry, Prometheus, ELK) and maintain runbooks for incidents. Retain logs for an appropriate period for auditing and investigations.  
  Why it matters: Detects and enables fast response to breaches or anomalous behavior, supports forensic analysis, and meets compliance needs.

- Dependency & Vulnerability Management  
  Keep third-party packages up to date, run automated dependency scanning (Dependabot, Snyk), and regularly audit container images. Apply security patches promptly.  
  Why it matters: Many incidents stem from known vulnerabilities in dependencies; proactive management reduces exposure.

- Deployment & Network Hardening  
  Use private networks for internal services (DB, Redis, workers), restrict management interfaces, enforce IAM/network rules, and run services behind a WAF/load balancer. Use container security best practices (non-root containers, minimal images).  
  Why it matters: Limits attack surface and reduces the risk of lateral movement if one component is compromised.

- Data Protection & Privacy  
  Limit collection of PII to what's required, provide mechanisms for data access and deletion (GDPR/CCPA considerations), and store audit trails of data access. Apply minimization and retention policies.  
  Why it matters: Protects user privacy, reduces liability, and helps ensure regulatory compliance.

Implementation notes and recommended tools
- Use Django & DRF authentication backends, django-oauth-toolkit or OAuth2 libraries for third-party flows, and djangorestframework-simplejwt for JWT support.  
- Use Redis-backed throttling (DRF throttling or api-gateway) and implement ip/user rate limits.  
- Integrate CSP and secure headers with django-secure or middleware.  
- Use vault or cloud secrets managers for credentials and configure CI/CD to use ephemeral secrets.  
- Enable dependency scanning (Dependabot/Snyk) and run container image scans in CI.

## üöÄ CI/CD Pipeline
Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment/Delivery (CD) are automated workflows that build, test, and deploy code whenever changes are pushed to the repository. CI ensures that changes are validated early (through linting, unit and integration tests, and security scans), while CD automates delivering those validated changes to staging and production environments. Together they reduce manual errors, speed up delivery, and increase confidence in releases.

Recommended CI/CD steps for this project:
- CI (on push / PR): checkout code, install dependencies, run linters (flake8/black), run unit & integration tests, run static analysis/security scanners (bandit, safety), build Docker images, run container image scans.
- CD (on merged main / tagged releases): push Docker images to a registry (GitHub Container Registry, Docker Hub), run database migrations against staging, deploy to staging and (after approvals) to production, run post-deploy smoke tests and health checks.
- Additional automation: run Dependabot/Snyk alerts, automated canary or blue/green deployments, and scheduled jobs for backup and maintenance.

Tools & services to consider
- GitHub Actions: native CI/CD runner tightly integrated with the repo; use workflows for builds, tests, and deployments.
- Docker & Docker Compose: build reproducible container images for the app, worker, and supporting services.
- Container Registry: GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io) or Docker Hub for storing images.
- Kubernetes / Helm or Docker Swarm: orchestrate deployments for scalable production environments (optional for advanced deployments).
- Terraform / Pulumi / CloudFormation: provision cloud infrastructure (databases, load balancers, networks).
- Helm / Flux / ArgoCD: GitOps tools for managing deployments declaratively (if using Kubernetes).
- Monitoring & Rollback: integrate with Prometheus/Grafana, Sentry for errors, and configure automatic rollbacks or alerts on failed deploys.

Best practices
- Keep CI jobs fast and parallelize where possible; run heavy integration tests on a separate pipeline.
- Use environment-specific configurations and secrets managed by the CI/CD platform or a secrets manager.
- Require branch protection rules (PR reviews, passing checks) before merging to main.
- Make deployments idempotent and use migration strategies that avoid downtime (backfills, zero-downtime migrations).
- Keep infrastructure-as-code in the repository and version control pipeline definitions.
